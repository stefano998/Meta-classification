Software: Octave

Instructions:

Run the numbered files in the ascending order
Files with the same number can run simultaneously
The unnumbered files do not need to be started by the user (they are triggered by the numbered files automatically)

Description of the main Octave codes:

01.Ev_L1.m: compute the covariance matrix of residuals (MinL1).
01.save_outs_positions.m: simulate and save the matrix with the position of the outliers for each scenario simulated
02.v_L1.m: compute the residuals vector for each scenario simulated (MinL1).
02.v_LInf.m: compute the residuals vector for each scenario simulated (MinLInf).
03.w_CV_IDS.m: compute test statistics and the critical value for outlier identification (IDS).
03.w_CV_L1.m: compute test statistics and the critical value for outlier identification (MinL1).
03.w_CV_LInf.m: compute test statistics and the critical value for outlier identification (MinLInf).
03.w_CV_SLRTMO.m: compute test statistics and the critical value for outlier identification (SLRTMO).
04.MinL1.m: compute the accuracy in outlier identification (MinL1).
04.MinLInf.m: compute the accuracy in outlier identification (MinLInf).
04.IDS.m: compute the accuracy in outlier identification (IDS).
04.SLRTMO.m: compute the accuracy in outlier identification (SLRTMO).
acc_score.m: function to compute accuracy in outlier identification.
functionIDS: function to identify outliers (IDS)
functionSLRTMO: function to identify outliers (SLRTMO)
get_network.m: function that returns all information needed about each geodetic network analyzed
gera_smc.m: generates Monte Carlo simulations (with outliers)
gera_smc_0outdif.m: generates Monte Carlo simulations (without outliers)
